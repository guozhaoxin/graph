'''
this file is used to show how kruskal works.
the basic thought is:
1 firstly we sort all the edges in the graph ascending,to complete this step,we can make
   a new structure:
   struct EdgeSet{
    int start; // the start node's index ,we can also use the node's name
    int end; // the end node's index, we can also use the node's name
    int weight; // the distance between the 2 nodes, in kruskal,the weight value cannot be 0 or infinite
   }
  we then make a array containing all EdgeSet type var and sort by ascending.
2 we scan the EdgeSet array from small to large,every we add a path(or EdgeSet element) to the result,
    we check if the result will have a ring after adding such a path,if so,we discard such a path and 
    continue to check next path.
    then how to judge if the res has ring?
    we can give every node a root, in such case, those nodes using the same node as root node will in a same tree,
    assume now we get the path pair(i,j),if j and j have the same root,then we can know adding the path will
    result in a ring appearing in the result,discard it.
    to record the root node,we can design a new array whose lengthen equal to the count of the nodes whille
    only int eles appear in the array,initially all the elements are -1, meaning all nodes use itself as root
    node,assume we have 5 nodes,then the array is:
        array = [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]
    from the first edgeSet to last,we check if the start and end nodes are in the same tree,if so ,skip;
    if not,we must find the 2 nodes' root node,assuming A,B ,then we check who has more children,if A has more,
    join the two trees in A, we can set array[A] += array[B],while set array[B] = A
3 lastly,we must know if res's lengthen < nodecount - 1,then the graph has no MST,we must return empty result.

to use the method,such as :
    res = kruskal(matrix)
the matrix is the graph's adj matrix, you must ensure all elements are int or float and never < 0.
